## InstaFake Classifier 
The term project proposes detection of fake and automated accounts, which lead to fake engagement in Instagram. We will be taking a research paper by Fatih Cagatay Akyon and Esat Kalfaoglu on the topic Instagram Fake and Automated Account Detection as our term project. We are using models such as Naive Bayes , SVM and neural networks to classify such accounts. We aim at reproducing the results and inferences mentioned in the above paper and achieve better accuracy in fake and automated accounts detection.
